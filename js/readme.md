This project adapts [p5js-osc](https://github.com/genekogan/p5js-osc/tree/master) to let a [p5](https://p5js.org/) sketch interact with a [nannou](https://nannou.cc/) sketch through [osc](https://opensoundcontrol.stanford.edu/index.html).

First ```npm install``` to build ```bridge.js```

To run the project
- ```node bridge.js```
- run the p5 sketch
